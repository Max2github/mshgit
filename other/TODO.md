# BUGS

## object
passing an object as an argument to a function only transfers a part of the object

## list
list-add() seems not to work globally anymore (?).

# TODO

## OBJECT
changing members of objects is jet not possible inside functions.
- ~~make it possible for gloabal Vars (easy)~~ ✔
- make it possible for local Vars (not so easy)

## LOCAL vs GLOBAL VARS
Just do something (check what works + implement what is missing).
- Global Vars can be changed inside funcs (including objects and Arrays)
- ~~Global Vars can be called inside funcs (including objects and Arrays)~~ ✔
